  * Campbell Biology in Focus is the best-selling “short” textbook for the introductory college biology course for science majors. Every unit takes an approach to streamlining the material that best fits the needs of instructors, based on surveys, curriculum initiatives, reviews, discussions with hundreds of biology professors, careful analyses of course syllabi, and the report Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education. The Second Edition builds on the Campbell hallmark standards of accuracy, clarity, and pedagogical innovation, going beyond this foundation to help students make connections visually across chapters, interpret real data from research, and synthesize their knowledge.The accompanying digital resources include new, mobile-friendly tools that help instructors teach challenging topics better than ever before; integrate the eText with videos and animations; and allow students to test, learn, and retest until they achieve mastery of the content.
